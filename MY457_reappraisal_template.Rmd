```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# this chunk contains code that sets global options for the entire .Rmd. 
# we use include=FALSE to suppress it from the top of the document, but it will still appear in the appendix. 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, linewidth=60)

# you can include your libraries here:
library(tidyverse)

# and any other options in R:
options(scipen=999)

```

# R Markdown

Your final reappraisal should be a **.pdf**. You should make a copy of this document, change then name, and edit the copy. Click the **Knit** button in `RStudio` to render the .pdf document. Your reappraisal should thus be a fully reproducible document, that someone other than you can simply open and run to reproduce all your result and analyses. 

While you may code in a literate way (text followed by code chunks), the majority of your code should appear **only** in the code appendix at the end of the document once the .pdf is rendered. The main part of your document should be written text, plus tables, plots. Please only include code chunks if they are relevant (e.g. if you want to discuss a particular issue you encountered in detail). Please **do not** include raw `R` output in the main document. Format your outputs properly by making proper tables, plots, or otherwise. Keep your document clean and professional, like you would expect to see in a professional reappraisal or reproduction. 

# Code
`R Markdown` documents allow you to write and evaluate (run) code in `chunks`, which can support a variety of languages. For this class you will only need to use `R`. It is always advisable to given your chunks meaningful names. You can set specific options in the code chunk, or you can set global options that can be overridden by specific chunks. Your code should be well-formatted and clearly written, and we advise heavy commenting of code using the normal `R` style. In this document we leave an open line at the end of code chunks to make the code appendix easier to follow. 

Note that you can source functions into the document using `source(functions/your_function.R)`, where `your_function.R` is a script contained in the `functions` directory one level below this .Rmd file.

In general, if you include a code chunk that does something you do not need to set additional options. The global options used in this template mean that code won't be print in your main document, but will be printed in your code appendix. This is the preferred approach to most code you write for your reappraisal. 

```{r useful_chunk_name}
# nothing in this chunk will be printed in the main document 
# except the output of the code.
print("hello world")

```

If you do want to include and run some code for some reason, you should use `echo=TRUE` in the chunk options. Please use this sparingly as it can become overwhelming very quickly if you include lots of code in your write-up. This is why we have the code appendix. 

```{r show-and-run-me, echo=TRUE}
# everything in this chunk will be printed in the main document, 
# plus the output of the code.
print("hello world")

```

By contrast, if you just want to include code but not run it  (e.g. to illustrate something without producing and including any results), you should use `echo=TRUE` and `eval=FALSE`:

```{r show-dont-run-me, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# everything in this chunk will be printed in the main document, 
# but the code won't run and so the output won't be included.
print("hello world")

```

# In-line references
It can often be useful to use in-line references to the value of particular objects that are defined in your `R` environment. For example, you might generate an estimate in `R` and want to discuss or interpret that estimate in your write-up. Referencing the value of an object from your environment will look like this in your markdown text: `` `r knitr::inline_expr("object_name")` ``. Below we provide a practical example.

```{r defining-alpha, echo=TRUE}
# here we define alpha, so that we have an object to reference in-line
alpha <- 12345

```

The value of alpha is equal to `r alpha`. You can also do operations in-line. The value of alpha divided by 10 is `r alpha/10`.

# Plots
To produce and include plots, create a chunk of code which generates the plot. Because the global options are set as `echo=FALSE` the code itself will not be shown, only the plot. Please give your figures labels, and discuss them in your text. You can do this by referencing the figure using `\@ref(fig:chunk-name)` in-line. For example, Figure \@ref(fig:cars-plot) shows the cars data. 

```{r cars-plot, fig.cap="A simple scatterplot of the cars data"}
# making a simple scatterplot using the cars data
plot(cars)

```

# Tables
To produce and include tables, create a chunk of code which generates the table. You can generate the table using numerous `R` packages including but not limited to `xtable`, `mtable`, `stargazer`, `kable` and `kable extra`. Below we shown an example using `kable` from the `knitr` package. Because the global options are set as `echo=FALSE` the code itself will not be shown, only the plot. As with figures, pelase give your tables labels, and discuss them in your text. You can do this by referencing the table using `\@ref(tab:chunk-name)` in-line. For example, Table \@ref(tab:mtcars-table) shows the cars data. 

```{r mtcars-table}
# making a simple table of the mtcars data
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5,], caption = "The first five rows of mtcars")

```

# Code appendix
Please make sure that the vast majority of your code appears here and not in-line. However, if you are using functions that you have defined in a separate script, you can simply include the source call in the appendix, and not the function definition itself. 

```{r ref.label = knitr::all_labels(), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# this chunk generates the complete code appendix. 
# eval=FALSE tells R not to re-run (``evaluate'') the code here. 
```
